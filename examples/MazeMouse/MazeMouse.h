/*
 * Maze-learning mouse.
 *
 * A client for maze learning task. Server runs mona neural network.
 *
 * The user can train a mouse to learn a path through a maze to obtain cheese.
 * The mouse is initially presented with one of a set of three possible doors
 * that leads to the beginning of a maze. That door choice can be associated
 * with a door choice at the end of the maze in order to obtain the cheese.
 * The intermediate task is navigating a path through the maze.
