# Mona

This is a fork of Mona neural network library. In this fork, Mona is converted to use U++ conventions and library. Also examples are converted.

The conversion is currently progressing, and it has following steps:
1. Move the original code to the target file structure, using TheIDE.
2. Convert code to use U++ conventions (upgrade old style) and to use U++ functions.

3. Convert examples to use CtrlLib instead of GLUT for GUI.
4. Add fast - forward, plotters and other debug drawers.
5. Use code in two own examples.
